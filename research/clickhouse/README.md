# Upload data to Clickhouse

1. `cd clickhouse`
2. `docker-compose up`
3. `python upload_from_file.py`

Here we use `SELECT * FROM file` method to upload data to Clickhouse from data.csv file created before. Thanks to multiprocessing upload is going for seconds not for minutes.

```commandline
Upload chunk_size=100.000 rows to file in 1.9522244930267334 seconds
Insert 10.000.000 (num_chunks=100, chunk_size=100.000) rows in 1.4755141735076904 seconds

## Review
Clickhouse works faster with 100-1000 amount of chunks. The best result for upload for clickhouse is two times faster than the best result for Vertica. Also, ClickHouse often fails during upload with the error below. As a result I see only 9970000 rows instead of 1M.
```Code: 1000.
DB::Exception: I/O error: Too many open files. Stack trace:
```
or just
```commandline
Code: 100. Unknown packet 4 from server localhost:9000

# Read data from Clickhouse

1. `cd clickhouse`
2. `docker-compose up`
3. `python upload_from_file.py` - It will create data.csv. It's mandatory for `read.py`
4. `python read.py` - Some load (insert 10000 rows) to the database will be emulated during reading.

```commandline
query = 
            """
        SELECT
            user_id,
            max(viewed_frame)
        FROM user_viewed_frame
        WHERE ts > '2022-12-01 00:00:00'
        GROUP by user_id
        """

I) Select all rows in 1.7852933406829834 seconds
II) Select all rows in 1.8951201438903809 seconds 
III) Select all rows in 1.8790724277496338 seconds
```

Results are the same during sequential calls. 

```commandline
Select all rows in 9.48959493637085 seconds
for query
        """
        SELECT
            user_id
        FROM user_viewed_frame
        WHERE ts > '2022-12-01 00:00:00'
        """

## Review
Reading not aggregated data from Clickhouse is 4 times faster than from Vertica. Reading of aggregated data is 2 times faster but if you make the same request few times than Vertica becomes faster (Probably vertica creates index behind the scenes).
